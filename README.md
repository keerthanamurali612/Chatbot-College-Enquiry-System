<h3>Flask Project Layout: </h3>
<p> A Flask application can be as simple as a single file.</p> 
<p>hello.py </p>

```
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

<h3>Templates: </h3>
<p> Templates are files that contain static data as well as placeholders for dynamic data. A template is rendered with specific data to produce a final document. Flask uses the Jinja template library to render templates.</p> <br>

<p> You‚Äôve written the authentication views for your application, but if you‚Äôre running the server and try to go to any of the URLs, you‚Äôll see a TemplateNotFound error. That‚Äôs because the views are calling render_template(), but you haven‚Äôt written the templates yet. The template files will be stored in the templates directory inside the flaskr package.</p><br>

<p>üìÅIn my project file is template/index.html </p>

<h3>Static Files: </h3>
<p> The authentication views and templates work, but they look very plain right now. Some CSS can be added to add style to the HTML layout you constructed. The style won‚Äôt change, so it‚Äôs a static file rather than a template.

</p> 
<p> üìÅIn my project static file is static/chat.css  </p>

```
{{ url_for('static', filename='style.css') }}
```
